CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

The different types of front end development I used includes Express HTML, JavaScript, and SPA. These were very different and I think created very different viewing experiences. For example the Express HTML produced a more typical web page design with a better and more appealing UI for users. While SPA was far more simplistic with its design but was able to full fill CRUD functionality for the admin users. Also the use of the MongoDB was a good option for this webpage because of its flexability which made CRUD work the most efficiently.

Functionality

JSON and Javascript were different tools that were used to complete both sides of the development process. JSON is different to JavaScript in that it is easier to read and understand and works well with JavaScript but can not serve as many functions but does better with storing and adjusting data. This was used together with the CRUD proccess that worked together through the JavaScript to make changes to the JSON files that would change the display on the webpage.

Testing

Testing was a lot of work that was best done throughout the entire development to find problems as the come up so they are easier to fix. I ran into a lot of issues through the development cycle but this method made it easier to fix mistakes while looking through the API I could notice if something I just changed did not appear corretly. 

Reflection

This course has helped me so much to learn the web development cycle and has introduced me to a new field that I would be interested to work in. It has also given me the experience I need to create a firm foundation of my knowledge in the form of this project. I have learned a lot about HTML and feel far more confident in those skills, but I also think I have mastered some skills in SPA and JavaScript.
